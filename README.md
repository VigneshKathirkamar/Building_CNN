# Building a CNN
This repository is to illustrate how to construct a simple cnn using Tensorflow with help of jupyter notebook with detailed illustration

## What is a CNN?
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network. As the name goes, this Neural Network does convolution on the input images (remember images are nothing but matrix). 

### What is Convolution
It would be easy to remember convolution as wrong matrix multiplication and addition rather than getting into the mathematical formulation for the beginner level. Now let's see what is wrong matrix multiplication and addition in the below figure
